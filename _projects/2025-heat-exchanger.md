The experiment involves:
•	one heat exchanger
•	two water pumps
•	4 water buckets
•	ice
•	water
•	styrofoam for insulation
•	an immersion heater
•	one thermocouple
•	four thermometers
•	food dye

The directions were as follows:
The four ports of the heat exchanger are labeled – 1 flows to 2 (and visa versa), and 3 flows
to 4 (and visa versa). Use the bucket with the attached immersion heater as the hot water
source and place a pump inside. Use the bucket with the Styrofoam insulation as the cold
water source and place a pump inside. Set and measure the temperature of these two
reservoirs. Be sure to start with these reservoirs completely full
to maximize your run time. Direct the tubes from the other two
heat reservoir ports into the other two buckets (please be
careful about where these are facing). Please ask a TA to add
dye to one of the reservoirs if it is not already colored. We
recommend setting up thermometers in each of the reservoirs.
You may also consider monitoring temperature of the heat
exchanger itself. When you are ready to operate the heat
exchanger turn on the power to the pumps (shown to the right)
using the power strip.

The setup was as follows with two pumps stemming from a hot reservoir and a cold reservoir. The working fluid entered a heat exchanger and then was deposited into two bins.

The following is a picture of the cross section of the heat exchanger device that was used. Clearly, there are many spaces for the fluids to interact with one another without direct contact to transfer heat.

The data that my group collected was the temperatures of the cold and hot fluid, named based on their initial temperatures relative to one another.

In a heat exchanger set up in anti-parallel, the hot fluid went from 49.5 to 22 degrees Celsius, and the cold fluid went from 0 to 29 degrees Celsius. We know the cold fluid was at 0 degrees Celsius because there was ice in the water. The heat exchanger itself went from 25 degrees to 30 degrees Celsius.  

In a parallel flow set-up, the hot fluid went from 48 to 31 degrees Celsius, and the cold fluid went from 15.2 to 30 degrees Celsius. The heat exchanger went from 19.8 to 35 degrees Celsius.

Analysis:
Counter-flow heat exchangers are more effective, as seen by the larger temperature differences in the fluids when using this set-up. This is due to the difference in temperatures of the two fluids remaining relatively high throughout the flow in the heat exchanger. 

Looking at the hot fluid, the change in temperature is larger in the first counter-flow set-up.
Counter-flow hot ΔT: 49.5 − 22 = 27.5 °C
Parallel-flow hot ΔT: 48 − 31 = 17 °C

This is a typical diagram of a heat exchanger with a parallel set-up:

Q out or heat leaves the hot fluid and enters the cold fluid as Q in. 

However, in our case, surprisingly the hot fluid ended with a lower temperature than the cold fluid. 

Assumptions:
Typically, it is assumed that the heat exchanger is adiabatic. However, since there were measured differences in temperature of its walls in both cases, heat was clearly transferred across the heat exchanger system boundary. 


Potential Changes to Design:
Changing the flow rates of the pumps would change the amount of heat that is transferred in the heat exchanger. A faster flow rate would mean that a given mass of the working fluid is not in the heat exchanger for as long and transfers less heat.

Other Aspects:
Heat exchangers exist in the real world in HVAC systems, refrigerators, power plants and in any other process where heat should be exchanged between two fluids without mixing them directly.

Additionally, true steady-state operation was difficult to achieve due to finite reservoir sizes and thermal energy storage in the heat exchanger. The gradual increase in exchanger wall temperature suggests the system was still approaching steady state during measurements.

Still, overall, the observed decrease in temperature of the hot fluid and the increased temperature of the cold fluid aligns with the theoretical behavior of heat exchangers.
